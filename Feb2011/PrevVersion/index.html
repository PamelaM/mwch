Newton resident and former Franklin parent <b>Rob Siegel</b>
(<a href='http://www.robsiegel.com'>robsiegel.com</a>) is well known in Boston
folk music circles as an innovative songwriter who produces memorable,
intelligent, well-crafted songs rooted in his suburban existence. Whether
probing the mysteries of religion, the awkwardness of running into an old flame
who didn't remember him, or fantasizing about running into his 21-year-old self
and drinking him under the table, Rob's songs provide both funny and serious
vectors to connect with an audience. Sing Out magazine says <i>"Siegel's talents
run far wider than great writing; he is uniquely entertaining and thoughtful."</i>
Rob has opened for Bill Staines, Vance Gilbert, Jack Hardy, and others. His
recent CD "Voices from the Right Brain: Rob Siegel Live at Club Passim" reached
#52 on the Folk DJ charts.</td><td>
