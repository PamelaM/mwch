Newton resident and former Franklin parent <b>Rob Siegel</b>
(<a href='http://www.robsiegel.com'>robsiegel.com</a>) is well known in Boston
folk music circles as an innovative songwriter who produces memorable,
intelligent, well-crafted songs rooted in his suburban existence. Whether
probing the mysteries of religion, the awkwardness of running into an old flame
who didn't remember him, or fantasizing about running into his 21-year-old self
and drinking him under the table, Rob's songs provide both funny and serious
vectors to connect with an audience. Sing Out magazine says <i>"Siegel's talents
run far wider than great writing; he is uniquely entertaining and thoughtful."</i>
Rob has opened for Bill Staines, Vance Gilbert, Jack Hardy, and others. His
recent CD "Voices from the Right Brain: Rob Siegel Live at Club Passim" reached
#52 on the Folk DJ charts.</td><td>

<td width='500'>Former Newton resident <b>Mark Stepakoff</b>
(<a href='http://www.markstepakoff.com'>markstepakoff.com</a>) enjoys a growing reputation as one of 
the area's sharpest songwriters. Mark won first place in both the Great American
Song Contest and the American Songwriter Magazine's lyric contest, and was a 
finalist in the USA Songwriting and Plowshares Songwriting contests.  Mark is 
best known for his laugh-out-loud funny material which has received airplay 
on Dr. Demento's nationally syndicated radio program. Mark's wry sense of 
humor takes on subjects as diverse as barbecue sauce, General Gao's chicken, 
and actress Amanda Peet. But his serious material is also riveting; his moving 
ballad about Boston's 1972 Hotel Vendome fire led to an invitation for him to 
perform the song at a memorial service for the firefighters who perished.</td></tr></table>
