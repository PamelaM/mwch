<p>The eighth annual Midwinter Coffeehouse was held at 7:00 pm,
Saturday, February 9th, at the First Unitarian Society Parish Hall,
1326 Washington St, West Newton. This event, presented as a benefit
for The Parent Teacher Organization (PTO) of the Franklin Public
Elementary School in West Newton, is one of Newton's only regular
coffeehouses, and features singer/songwriters active in the Boston
folk music community who have donated their time to benefit the PTO.
The tradition of excellence continued in this, the eighth year of this
unique fundraising event, with award-winning songwriter, Newton
resident, and Franklin parent Catie Curtis.</p>

<p><b>Catie Curtis</b> (<a href='http://catiecurtis.com/'>catiecurtis.com</a>) 
has headlined clubs and theaters throughout the US since the
mid-nineties. She has shared the bill with artists such as Dar
Williams and Richard Thompson and toured in Europe with Mary Chapin
Carpenter. Catie's grassroots fan base has grown by word of mouth over
the years based on the strength of her recordings and live shows. A
supporter of social causes, Curtis has played concerts benefiting
organizations including Paul Newman's Hole In the Wall Gang Camp,
Women of Means (medical care for homeless women), and many others. Her
songs have appeared in television shows as diverse as Grey's Anatomy,
Dawson's Creek, Felicity, and Alias. Her new CD "Long Night Moon"
features the Katrina-themed track "People Look Around" for which
Curtis (along with co-writer Mark Erelli) was honored with the Grand
Prize in this year's International Songwriting Competition (out of
15,000 entries from 82 countries). </p>

Staines, Vance Gilbert, Jack Hardy and others. His recent CD "Voices
from the Right Brain: Rob Siegel Live at Club Passim" reached #52 on
